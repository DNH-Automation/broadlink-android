# broadlink-android
This project is based on leaked sample Broadlink SDK code. I refactored it to make it a lot easier to use than original code.

I am also implementing the ability to steal device & IR data directly from Broadlink Android app.

This is also the base code for my Tasker-Broadlink plugin in near future (not open source).
